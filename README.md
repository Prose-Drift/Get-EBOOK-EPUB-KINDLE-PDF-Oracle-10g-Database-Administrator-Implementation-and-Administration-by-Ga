Oracle 10g: Database Administrator: Implementation and Administration (DBA1) uses the most current database release from Oracle to provide thorough coverage of an Oracle database through the day-to-day duties of a database administrator. This real-world approach, combined with topics ranging from initialization parameters and table space storage to data integrity, constraints, and user profiles, provides good preparation for the update Oracle certification exam, Database Fundamentals I (#1Z0-041). In addition to extensive review material, the end of chapter content also includes comprehensive coverage of the exam objectives and exam-like practice qu

Oracle 10g Database Administrator: Implementation and Administration by Gavin Powell,Carol McCullough-Dieter Book Review

Name: M. Lewis
Rating: 4.0 out of 5 stars
Title: .0 out of 5 stars Nothing Fancy
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2009
Review: I found this text helpful and informative, but it's not exactly a thrilling read. I bought it for a college course. Chances are, if you're looking at this review, that's your reason for purchasing, too. Buy it. It's a good resource.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Poorly written
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2012
Review: I'm glad my professor gave us lists of terms to look for in this book, because that's the only way I'd get anything out of it. It's very disjointed, and at times it seems like it's written for someone who already knows Oracle. The review questions at the end of the chapters are next to impossible, since the information they're asking for doesn't seem to be in the book. The hands-on stuff is mostly impossible since you probably won't have the programs it's asking for. Also, the CD is pretty much worthless. It's highly unlikely that the software will work on your computer. My professor told us not to even try. Someone did try, and has to reinstall Windows now.

Review: This book is great if you are taken a college course or using it to study for the oracle admin test. It can become a little detailed in information, but for the most part, great study tool.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars perfect for pedantic pedagogues of the 70's
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2010
Review: The title of the this review includes the words "pedagogue" for "teachers, or the art of teaching," and "pedantic" for "focus on details, often at the expense of good scholarship." The "70's" is for the 1970's, when Oracle was one of the premier database products available, and also for the teaching style of this book.

In fairness, the writer encountered this book on implementation and administration prior to learning Oracle's database and SQL (Structured Query Language) as a user, and without a chance to brush up on modern versions of unix and linux (while Oracle is multi-platform software, these are it's current "home" operating systems).

But, still: The text drags the student through several chapters of quite detailed "forest" before getting to a place where any "hands-on" learning can occur. Worse, the procedures and examples in the text don't necessarily match the way the software actually works, at least when installed on Microsoft Windows.

Also: Oracle is designed for HUGE databases. The "developers license" software, installed on a home PC, consumes an incredible amount of memory and disk, and it automatically loads itself at system startup (to alter this, edit the registry, but make sure you know how to otherwise start and stop the database system first).

Bottom line: The book is actually a good description of the Oracle 10g Database System. However, the current version is 11g. As a text the teaching style is archaic. As a reference its organization is insufficient. If this is your choice for learning Oracle administration and implementation, this writer would recommend learning Oracle as a user beforehand, and perhaps also learning linux or unix at the command-line level.

Review: I bought this for my Oracle Architecture and Admininistration class and it was almost perfect except my instructor didn't like the order that the chapters were in and the book lacks some detail as to how you actually do some of the things mentioned in it.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Worst Book I ever bought - do not waste your time or money
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2007
Review: This book is the worst book that I ever purchased.

I have purchased two other Thomson Course Technology Books and both were excellent:

Oracle9i: SQL, with an Introduction to PL/SQL
Oracle9i Developer: PL/SQL Programming

This book was required for an Oracle Admin Class that I'm taking. I have a 4.0 cumulative GPA and I have already passed the 1Z0-042.

I had read the reviews prior to purchasing the book but I was hoping that they were a little exaggerated. Unfortunately I have to agree with the other negative reviews of this book.

To put it mildly, this book is very unstructured, inaccurate and repetitive.

To study in preparation for the Exam for my course, I had to create my own outline and Google to gather correct information.

If you need a good book try Oracle Database 10g OCP Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, or any other book...
